\begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
Seb Madgwick Fusion is an A\+N\+SI C99 compliment sensor fusion library for sensor arrays of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers. Fusion was specifically developed for use with embedded systems and has been optimised for execution speed. The library includes modules for\+: attitude and heading reference system (A\+H\+RS) sensor fusion, gyroscope bias correction, and a tilt-\/ compensated compass.
