\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md183}{}\doxysubsection{Welcome to c\+J\+S\+O\+N.}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md183}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} aims to be the dumbest possible parser that you can get your job done with. It\textquotesingle{}s a single file of C, and a single header file.

J\+S\+ON is described best here\+: \href{http://www.json.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+json.\+org/}} It\textquotesingle{}s like X\+ML, but fat-\/free. You use it to move data around, store things, or just generally represent your program\textquotesingle{}s state.

As a library, \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} exists to take away as much legwork as it can, but not get in your way. As a point of pragmatism (i.\+e. ignoring the truth), I\textquotesingle{}m going to say that you can use it in one of two modes\+: Auto and Manual. Let\textquotesingle{}s have a quick run-\/through.

I lifted some J\+S\+ON from this page\+: \href{http://www.json.org/fatfree.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+json.\+org/fatfree.\+html}} That page inspired me to write \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}, which is a parser that tries to share the same philosophy as J\+S\+ON itself. Simple, dumb, out of the way.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md184}{}\doxysubsection{Building}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md184}
There are several ways to incorporate \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} into your project.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md185}{}\doxysubsubsection{copying the source}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md185}
Because the entire library is only one C file and one header file, you can just copy {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{c_j_s_o_n_8h_source}{c\+J\+S\+O\+N.\+h}}} and {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N.\+c} to your projects source and start using it.

\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} is written in A\+N\+SI C (C89) in order to support as many platforms and compilers as possible.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md186}{}\doxysubsubsection{C\+Make}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md186}
With C\+Make, \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} supports a full blown build system. This way you get the most features. C\+Make with an equal or higher version than 2.\+8.\+5 is supported. With C\+Make it is recommended to do an out of tree build, meaning the compiled files are put in a directory separate from the source files. So in order to build \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} with C\+Make on a Unix platform, make a {\ttfamily build} directory and run C\+Make inside it.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will create a Makefile and a bunch of other files. You can then compile it\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\end{DoxyCode}


And install it with {\ttfamily make install} if you want. By default it installs the headers {\ttfamily /usr/local/include/cjson} and the libraries to {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib}. It also installs files for pkg-\/config to make it easier to detect and use an existing installation of C\+Make. And it installs C\+Make config files, that can be used by other C\+Make based projects to discover the library.

You can change the build process with a list of different options that you can pass to C\+Make. Turn them on with {\ttfamily On} and off with {\ttfamily Off}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+C\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST=On}\+: Enable building the tests. (on by default)

\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+V\+A\+L\+G\+R\+I\+ND=On}\+: Run tests with \href{http://valgrind.org}{\texttt{ valgrind}}. (off by default)
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+S\+A\+N\+I\+T\+I\+Z\+E\+RS=On}\+: Compile \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} with \href{https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer}{\texttt{ Address\+Sanitizer}} and \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html}{\texttt{ Undefined\+Behavior\+Sanitizer}} enabled (if possible). (off by default)
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+S\+A\+F\+E\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+CK}\+: Enable the \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html}{\texttt{ Safe\+Stack}} instrumentation pass. Currently only works with the Clang compiler. (off by default)
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+BS=On}\+: Build the shared libraries. (on by default)
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+A\+N\+D\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+I\+C\+\_\+\+L\+I\+BS=On}\+: Build both shared and static libraries. (off by default)
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+F\+IX=/usr}\+: Set a prefix for the installation.
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+L\+O\+C\+A\+L\+ES=On}\+: Enable the usage of localeconv method. ( on by default )
\item {\ttfamily -\/D\+C\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+O\+V\+E\+R\+R\+I\+D\+E\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+BS=On}\+: Enable overriding the value of {\ttfamily B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+BS} with {\ttfamily -\/D\+C\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+BS}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you are packaging \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} for a distribution of Linux, you would probably take these steps for example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .. -\/DENABLE\_CJSON\_UTILS=On -\/DENABLE\_CJSON\_TEST=Off -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/usr}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{make DESTDIR=\$pkgdir install}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Windows C\+Make is usually used to create a Visual Studio solution file by running it inside the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio, for exact steps follow the official documentation from C\+Make and Microsoft and use the online search engine of your choice. The descriptions of the the options above still generally apply, although not all of them work on Windows.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md187}{}\doxysubsubsection{Makefile}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md187}
{\bfseries{N\+O\+TE\+:}} This Method is deprecated. Use C\+Make if at all possible. Makefile support is limited to fixing bugs.

If you don\textquotesingle{}t have C\+Make available, but still have G\+NU make. You can use the makefile to build \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}\+:

Run this command in the directory with the source code and it will automatically compile static and shared libraries and a little test program (not the full test suite).


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make all}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you want, you can install the compiled library to your system using {\ttfamily make install}. By default it will install the headers in {\ttfamily /usr/local/include/cjson} and the libraries in {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib}. But you can change this behavior by setting the {\ttfamily P\+R\+E\+F\+IX} and {\ttfamily D\+E\+S\+T\+D\+IR} variables\+: {\ttfamily make P\+R\+E\+F\+IX=/usr D\+E\+S\+T\+D\+IR=temp install}. And uninstall them with\+: {\ttfamily make P\+R\+E\+F\+IX=/usr D\+E\+S\+T\+D\+IR=temp uninstall}.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md188}{}\doxysubsubsection{Vcpkg}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md188}
You can download and install \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} using the \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg}{\texttt{ vcpkg}} dependency manager\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

\DoxyCodeLine{vcpkg install cjson}
\end{DoxyCode}

If the version is out of date, please \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg}{\texttt{ create an issue or pull request}} on the vcpkg repository.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md189}{}\doxysubsection{Including c\+J\+S\+ON}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md189}
If you installed it via C\+Make or the Makefile, you can include \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} like this\+:

An item of this type represents a J\+S\+ON value. The type is stored in {\ttfamily type} as a bit-\/flag ({\bfseries{this means that you cannot find out the type by just comparing the value of {\ttfamily type}}}).

To check the type of an item, use the corresponding {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is...} function. It does a {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} check followed by a type check and returns a boolean value if the item is of this type.

The type can be one of the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Invalid} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Invalid})\+: Represents an invalid item that doesn\textquotesingle{}t contain any value. You automatically have this type if you set the item to all zero bytes.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+False} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+False})\+: Represents a {\ttfamily false} boolean value. You can also check for boolean values in general with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Bool}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+True} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+True})\+: Represents a {\ttfamily true} boolean value. You can also check for boolean values in general with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Bool}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+N\+U\+LL} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Null})\+: Represents a {\ttfamily null} value.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Number} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Number})\+: Represents a number value. The value is stored as a double in {\ttfamily valuedouble} and also in {\ttfamily valueint}. If the number is outside of the range of an integer, {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+\_\+\+M\+AX} or {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+\_\+\+M\+IN} are used for {\ttfamily valueint}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+String} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+String})\+: Represents a string value. It is stored in the form of a zero terminated string in {\ttfamily valuestring}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Array} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Array})\+: Represent an array value. This is implemented by pointing {\ttfamily child} to a linked list of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}} items that represent the values in the array. The elements are linked together using {\ttfamily next} and {\ttfamily prev}, where the first element has {\ttfamily prev == N\+U\+LL} and the last element {\ttfamily next == N\+U\+LL}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Object} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Object})\+: Represents an object value. Objects are stored same way as an array, the only difference is that the items in the object store their keys in {\ttfamily string}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Raw} (check with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Raw})\+: Represents any kind of J\+S\+ON that is stored as a zero terminated array of characters in {\ttfamily valuestring}. This can be used, for example, to avoid printing the same static J\+S\+ON over and over again to save performance. \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} will never create this type when parsing. Also note that \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} doesn\textquotesingle{}t check if it is valid J\+S\+ON.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Additionally there are the following two flags\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Reference}\+: Specifies that the item that {\ttfamily child} points to and/or {\ttfamily valuestring} is not owned by this item, it is only a reference. So {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete} and other functions will only deallocate this item, not it\textquotesingle{}s children/valuestring.
\item {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+String\+Is\+Const}\+: This means that {\ttfamily string} points to a constant string. This means that {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete} and other functions will not try to deallocate {\ttfamily string}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md191}{}\doxysubsection{Working with the data structure}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md191}
For every value type there is a {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create...} function that can be used to create an item of that type. All of these will allocate a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}} struct that can later be deleted with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}. Note that you have to delete them at some point, otherwise you will get a memory leak. {\bfseries{Important}}\+: If you have added an item to an array or an object already, you {\bfseries{mustn\textquotesingle{}t}} delete it with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}. Adding it to an array or object transfers its ownership so that when that array or object is deleted, it gets deleted as well.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md192}{}\doxysubsubsection{Basic types}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md192}

\item {\bfseries{null}} is created with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Null}
\item {\bfseries{booleans}} are created with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+True}, {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+False} or {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Bool}

If the number is outside of the range of an integer, {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+\_\+\+M\+AX} or {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+\_\+\+M\+IN} are used for {\ttfamily valueint}
\item {\bfseries{strings}} are created with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+String} (copies the string) or with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+String\+Reference} (directly points to the string. This means that {\ttfamily valuestring} won\textquotesingle{}t be deleted by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete} and you are responsible for it\textquotesingle{}s lifetime, useful for constants)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md193}{}\doxysubsubsection{Arrays}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md193}
You can create an empty array with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Array}. {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Array\+Reference} can be used to create an array that doesn\textquotesingle{}t \char`\"{}own\char`\"{} its content, so its content doesn\textquotesingle{}t get deleted by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}.

To add items to an array, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Item\+To\+Array} to append items to the end. Using {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Item\+Reference\+To\+Array} an element can be added as a reference to another item, array or string. This means that {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete} will not delete that items {\ttfamily child} or {\ttfamily valuestring} properties, so no double frees are occurring if they are already used elsewhere. To insert items in the middle, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Insert\+Item\+In\+Array}. It will insert an item at the given 0 based index and shift all the existing items to the right.

If you want to take an item out of an array at a given index and continue using it, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Detach\+Item\+From\+Array}, it will return the detached item, so be sure to assign it to a pointer, otherwise you will have a memory leak.

Deleting items is done with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete\+Item\+From\+Array}. It works like {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Detach\+Item\+From\+Array}, but deletes the detached item via {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}.

You can also replace an item in an array in place. Either with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+In\+Array} using an index or with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+Via\+Pointer} given a pointer to an element. {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+Via\+Pointer} will return {\ttfamily 0} if it fails. What this does internally is to detach the old item, delete it and insert the new item in its place.

To get the size of an array, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Array\+Size}. Use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Array\+Item} to get an element at a given index.

Because an array is stored as a linked list, iterating it via index is inefficient ({\ttfamily O(n²)}), so you can iterate over an array using the {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Array\+For\+Each} macro in {\ttfamily O(n)} time complexity.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md194}{}\doxysubsubsection{Objects}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md194}
You can create an empty object with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Object}. {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Create\+Object\+Reference} can be used to create an object that doesn\textquotesingle{}t \char`\"{}own\char`\"{} its content, so its content doesn\textquotesingle{}t get deleted by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}.

To add items to an object, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Item\+To\+Object}. Use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Item\+To\+Object\+CS} to add an item to an object with a name that is a constant or reference (key of the item, {\ttfamily string} in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}} struct), so that it doesn\textquotesingle{}t get freed by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}. Using {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Item\+Reference\+To\+Array} an element can be added as a reference to another object, array or string. This means that {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete} will not delete that items {\ttfamily child} or {\ttfamily valuestring} properties, so no double frees are occurring if they are already used elsewhere.

If you want to take an item out of an object, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Detach\+Item\+From\+Object\+Case\+Sensitive}, it will return the detached item, so be sure to assign it to a pointer, otherwise you will have a memory leak.

Deleting items is done with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete\+Item\+From\+Object\+Case\+Sensitive}. It works like {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Detach\+Item\+From\+Object\+Case\+Sensitive} followed by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}.

You can also replace an item in an object in place. Either with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+In\+Object\+Case\+Sensitive} using a key or with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+Via\+Pointer} given a pointer to an element. {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Replace\+Item\+Via\+Pointer} will return {\ttfamily 0} if it fails. What this does internally is to detach the old item, delete it and insert the new item in its place.

To get the size of an object, you can use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Array\+Size}, this works because internally objects are stored as arrays.

If you want to access an item in an object, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Object\+Item\+Case\+Sensitive}.

To iterate over an object, you can use the {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Array\+For\+Each} macro the same way as for arrays.

\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} also provides convenient helper functions for quickly creating a new item and adding it to an object, like {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Add\+Null\+To\+Object}. They return a pointer to the new item or {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} if they failed.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md195}{}\doxysubsection{Parsing J\+S\+ON}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md195}
Given some J\+S\+ON in a zero terminated string, you can parse it with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Parse}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{cJSON}} *json = cJSON\_Parse(\textcolor{keywordtype}{string});}
\end{DoxyCode}


It will parse the J\+S\+ON and allocate a tree of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}} items that represents it. Once it returns, you are fully responsible for deallocating it after use with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Delete}.

The allocator used by {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Parse} is {\ttfamily malloc} and {\ttfamily free} by default but can be changed (globally) with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Init\+Hooks}.

If an error occurs a pointer to the position of the error in the input string can be accessed using {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Error\+Ptr}. Note though that this can produce race conditions in multithreading scenarios, in that case it is better to use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Parse\+With\+Opts} with {\ttfamily return\+\_\+parse\+\_\+end}. By default, characters in the input string that follow the parsed J\+S\+ON will not be considered as an error.

If you want more options, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Parse\+With\+Opts(const char $\ast$value, const char $\ast$$\ast$return\+\_\+parse\+\_\+end, c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+bool require\+\_\+null\+\_\+terminated)}. {\ttfamily return\+\_\+parse\+\_\+end} returns a pointer to the end of the J\+S\+ON in the input string or the position that an error occurs at (thereby replacing {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Error\+Ptr} in a thread safe way). {\ttfamily require\+\_\+null\+\_\+terminated}, if set to {\ttfamily 1} will make it an error if the input string contains data after the J\+S\+ON.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md196}{}\doxysubsection{Printing J\+S\+ON}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md196}
Given a tree of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}}} items, you can print them as a string using {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{char} *\textcolor{keywordtype}{string} = cJSON\_Print(json);}
\end{DoxyCode}


It will allocate a string and print a J\+S\+ON representation of the tree into it. Once it returns, you are fully responsible for deallocating it after use with your allocator. (usually {\ttfamily free}, depends on what has been set with {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Init\+Hooks}).

{\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print} will print with whitespace for formatting. If you want to print without formatting, use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print\+Unformatted}.

If you have a rough idea of how big your resulting string will be, you can use {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print\+Buffered(const c\+J\+S\+O\+N $\ast$item, int prebuffer, c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+bool fmt)}. {\ttfamily fmt} is a boolean to turn formatting with whitespace on and off. {\ttfamily prebuffer} specifies the first buffer size to use for printing. {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print} currently uses 256 bytes for it\textquotesingle{}s first buffer size. Once printing runs out of space, a new buffer is allocated and the old gets copied over before printing is continued.

These dynamic buffer allocations can be completely avoided by using {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Print\+Preallocated(c\+J\+S\+O\+N $\ast$item, char $\ast$buffer, const int length, const c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+bool format)}. It takes a buffer to a pointer to print to and it\textquotesingle{}s length. If the length is reached, printing will fail and it returns {\ttfamily 0}. In case of success, {\ttfamily 1} is returned. Note that you should provide 5 bytes more than is actually needed, because \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} is not 100\% accurate in estimating if the provided memory is enough.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md197}{}\doxysubsection{Example}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md197}

Note that there are no N\+U\+LL checks except for the result of {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Parse} because {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Get\+Object\+Item\+Case\+Sensitive} checks for {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} inputs already, so a {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} value is just propagated and {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+Number} and {\ttfamily c\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Is\+String} return {\ttfamily 0} if the input is {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL}.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md200}{}\doxysubsection{Caveats}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md200}

\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} only supports U\+T\+F-\/8 encoded input. In most cases it doesn\textquotesingle{}t reject invalid U\+T\+F-\/8 as input though, it just propagates it through as is. As long as the input doesn\textquotesingle{}t contain invalid U\+T\+F-\/8, the output will always be valid U\+T\+F-\/8.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md203}{}\doxysubsubsection{C Standard}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md203}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} is written in A\+N\+SI C (or C89, C90). If your compiler or C library doesn\textquotesingle{}t follow this standard, correct behavior is not guaranteed.

N\+O\+TE\+: A\+N\+SI C is not C++ therefore it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be compiled with a C++ compiler. You can compile it with a C compiler and link it with your C++ code however. Although compiling with a C++ compiler might work, correct behavior is not guaranteed.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md204}{}\doxysubsubsection{Floating Point Numbers}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md204}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} does not officially support any {\ttfamily double} implementations other than I\+E\+E\+E754 double precision floating point numbers. It might still work with other implementations but bugs with these will be considered invalid.

The maximum length of a floating point literal that \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} supports is currently 63 characters.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md205}{}\doxysubsubsection{Deep Nesting Of Arrays And Objects}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md205}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} doesn\textquotesingle{}t support arrays and objects that are nested too deeply because this would result in a stack overflow. To prevent this \mbox{\hyperlink{structc_j_s_o_n}{c\+J\+S\+ON}} limits the depth to {\ttfamily C\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+N\+E\+S\+T\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+L\+I\+M\+IT} which is 1000 by default but can be changed at compile time.\hypertarget{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md206}{}\doxysubsubsection{Thread Safety}\label{md_c_j_s_o_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md206}
