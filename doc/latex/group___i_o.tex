\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer. 

Under Chibi\+OS the set of the various device driver interfaces is called the H\+AL subsystem\+: Hardware Abstraction Layer. The H\+AL is the abstract interface between Chibi\+OS applications and hardware.\hypertarget{group___i_o_hal_device_driver_arch}{}\doxysubsection{H\+A\+L Device Drivers Architecture}\label{group___i_o_hal_device_driver_arch}
The H\+AL contains several kind of modules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Normal Device Drivers
\item Complex Device Drivers
\item Interfaces
\item Inner Code
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group___i_o_hal_normal_device_drivers}{}\doxysubsection{H\+A\+L Normal Device Drivers}\label{group___i_o_hal_normal_device_drivers}
Normal device are meant to interface the application to the underlying hardware through an high level A\+PI. Normal Device Drivers are split in two layers\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item High Level Device Driver ({\bfseries{H\+LD}}). This layer contains the definitions of the driver\textquotesingle{}s A\+P\+Is and the platform independent part of the driver.~\newline
 An H\+LD is composed by two files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily hal\+\_\+$<$driver$>$}.c, the H\+LD implementation file. This file must be included in the Makefile in order to use the driver.
\item {\ttfamily hal\+\_\+$<$driver$>$}.h, the H\+LD header file. This file is implicitly included by the H\+AL header file {\ttfamily hal.\+h}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Low Level Device Driver ({\bfseries{L\+LD}}). This layer contains the platform dependent part of the driver.~\newline
 A L\+LD is composed by two files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily hal\+\_\+$<$driver$>$\+\_\+lld.\+c}, the L\+LD implementation file. This file must be included in the Makefile in order to use the driver.
\item {\ttfamily hal\+\_\+$<$driver$>$\+\_\+lld.\+h}, the L\+LD header file. This file is implicitly included by the H\+LD header file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{group___i_o_hal_complex_device_drivers}{}\doxysubsection{H\+A\+L Complex Device Drivers}\label{group___i_o_hal_complex_device_drivers}
It is a class of device drivers that offer an high level A\+PI but do not use the hardware directly. Complex device drivers use other drivers for accessing the machine resources.\hypertarget{group___i_o_hal_interfaces}{}\doxysubsection{H\+A\+L Interfaces}\label{group___i_o_hal_interfaces}
An interface is a binary structure allowing the access to a service using virtual functions. This allows to create drivers that can be accessed using a common interface. The concept of interface is commonly found in object-\/oriented languages like Java or C++, their meaning in Chibi\+O\+S/\+H\+AL is exactly the same.\hypertarget{group___i_o_hal_inner_code}{}\doxysubsection{H\+A\+L Inner Code}\label{group___i_o_hal_inner_code}
Some modules are shared among multiple device drivers and are not necessarily meant to be used by the application layer.
