I/O Ports Abstraction Layer. 

This module defines an abstract interface for digital I/O ports. Note that most I/O ports functions are just macros. The macros have default software implementations that can be redefined in a P\+AL Low Level Driver if the target hardware supports special features like, for example, atomic bit set/reset/masking. Please refer to the ports specific documentation for details.~\newline
 The \mbox{\hyperlink{group___p_a_l}{P\+AL Driver}} driver has the advantage to make the access to the I/O ports platform independent and still be optimized for the specific architectures.~\newline
 Note that the P\+AL Low Level Driver may also offer non standard macro and functions in order to support specific features but, of course, the use of such interfaces would not be portable. Such interfaces shall be marked with the architecture name inside the function names. \begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
In order to use the P\+AL driver the {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+P\+AL} option must be enabled in {\ttfamily halconf.\+h}.
\end{DoxyPrecond}
\hypertarget{group___p_a_l_pal_1}{}\doxysubsection{Implementation Rules}\label{group___p_a_l_pal_1}
In implementing a P\+AL Low Level Driver there are some rules/behaviors that should be respected.\hypertarget{group___p_a_l_pal_1_1}{}\doxysubsubsection{Writing on input pads}\label{group___p_a_l_pal_1_1}
The behavior is not specified but there are implementations better than others, this is the list of possible implementations, preferred options are on top\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The written value is not actually output but latched, should the pads be reprogrammed as outputs the value would be in effect.
\item The write operation is ignored.
\item The write operation has side effects, as example disabling/enabling pull up/down resistors or changing the pad direction. This scenario is discouraged, please try to avoid this scenario.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{group___p_a_l_pal_1_2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Reading from output pads}\label{group___p_a_l_pal_1_2}
The behavior is not specified but there are implementations better than others, this is the list of possible implementations, preferred options are on top\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The actual pads states are read (not the output latch).
\item The output latch value is read (regardless of the actual pads states).
\item Unspecified, please try to avoid this scenario.
