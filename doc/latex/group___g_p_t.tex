Generic G\+PT Driver. 

This module implements a generic G\+PT (General Purpose Timer) driver. The timer can be programmed in order to trigger callbacks after a specified time period or continuously with a specified interval. \begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
In order to use the G\+PT driver the {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+G\+PT} option must be enabled in {\ttfamily halconf.\+h}.
\end{DoxyPrecond}

The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

This driver abstracts a generic timer composed of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A clock prescaler.
\item A main up counter.
\item A comparator register that resets the main counter to zero when the limit is reached. A callback is invoked when this happens.
\end{DoxyItemize}The timer can operate in three different modes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Continuous Mode}}, a periodic callback is invoked until the driver is explicitly stopped.
\item {\bfseries{One Shot Mode}}, a callback is invoked after the programmed period and then the timer automatically stops.
\item {\bfseries{Delay Mode}}, the timer is used for inserting a brief delay into the execution flow, no callback is invoked in this mode.
\end{DoxyItemize}
