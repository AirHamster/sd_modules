Generic M\+MC driver. 

This module implements a portable M\+M\+C/\+SD driver that uses a S\+PI driver as physical layer. Hot plugging and removal are supported through kernel events. \begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
In order to use the M\+M\+C\+\_\+\+S\+PI driver the {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+M\+M\+C\+\_\+\+S\+PI} and {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+S\+PI} options must be enabled in {\ttfamily halconf.\+h}.
\end{DoxyPrecond}

This driver implements a state machine internally, see the \mbox{\hyperlink{group___i_o___b_l_o_c_k}{Abstract I/O Block Device}} module documentation for details.\hypertarget{group___m_m_c___s_p_i_mmc_spi_2}{}\doxysubsection{Driver Operations}\label{group___m_m_c___s_p_i_mmc_spi_2}
This driver allows to read or write single or multiple 512 bytes blocks on a SD Card.
