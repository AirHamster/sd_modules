Hardware Abstraction Layer. 

The H\+AL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) driver performs the system initialization and includes the platform support code shared by the other drivers. This driver does contain any A\+PI function except for a general initialization function {\ttfamily hal\+Init()} that must be invoked before any H\+AL service can be used, usually the H\+AL initialization should be performed immediately before the kernel initialization.~\newline
 Some H\+AL driver implementations also offer a custom early clock setup function that can be invoked before the C runtime initialization in order to accelerate the startup time.
