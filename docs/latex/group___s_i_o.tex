Generic S\+IO Driver. 

This driver abstracts a generic serial communication channel, usually an U\+A\+RT, this driver is similar to Serial and U\+A\+RT drivers but follows a different concept\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Very close to HW.
\item No buffering done in SW, the driver relies on the peripheral internal F\+I\+FO, if any.
\item Asynchronous, the A\+PI is always non blocking.
\item Callbacks capable, operations completion and other events are notified using callbacks.
\item Very short code paths, especially in I\+S\+Rs.
\end{DoxyItemize}\begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
In order to use the S\+IO driver the {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+S\+IO} option must be enabled in {\ttfamily halconf.\+h}.
\end{DoxyPrecond}
\hypertarget{group___s_i_o_sio_1}{}\doxysubsection{Driver State Machine}\label{group___s_i_o_sio_1}
The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
